# Parody-apple-event-project
 a parody project based on apple's old event transcripts to make prediction for future apple event

 ## Tools and Technologies used
    - Python
    - Hugging Face trainer
    - Fine tuning pre-trained model
    - Text to speech (TTS)
    
 ## steps
1. Data Collection: Gather transcripts from all previous Apple events. This data will be used to fine-tune a language model.

2. Model Selection: Choose a base transformer model from Hugging Face that is suitable for text generation. Models like GPT-3 or its alternatives could be good candidates.

3. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the event transcripts to be suitable for training the model. This might include removing any irrelevant sections, formatting the data, and splitting it into training and test sets.

4. Fine-Tuning: Use the preprocessed transcripts to fine-tune the chosen model. The fine-tuning process will adapt the base model to understand and replicate the style and content of Apple events.

5. Evaluation: Test the fine-tuned model using the transcript from the 2023 MacBook event. This step is to evaluate how well the model can generate text that resembles the content of an actual Apple event.

6. Prediction: Once the model is fine-tuned and evaluated, use it to generate a prediction for the next year's Apple event. This prediction would attempt to simulate what Apple might present in the future.

7. Voice Generation: Use ElevenLabs or a similar text-to-speech service to create a voiceover from the predicted transcript. This will give life to the text and make it sound like an actual event presentation.

8. Image Generation: Utilize an AI like Stable Diffusion or similar to create images that correspond to the predicted products or announcements. These images will be used to visually represent the predictions.

9. Video Production: Combine the voiceover and images, along with any additional footage or graphics, to create a cohesive video that mimics a real Apple event presentation.

10. Legal and Ethical Considerations: Ensure that the project does not infringe on copyrights and trademarks, and is clearly labeled as a speculative or parody project to avoid misleading viewers.

11. Deployment: Share the final video on platforms where your target audience can view it. This might be YouTube, Vimeo, or a dedicated landing page.
